      <h1>My Tech Journey</h1>
      <p>
        I started my tech journey in 2024. I wasn't involved in the tech space since i got admission in 2023 then i attended a nacosite tech convention. which got me exposed to the tech space.
        I explored web development and decided to start with the easiest language which is html. Or so i thought. i heard about genesys upskill program and signed up to start my tech journey from there
